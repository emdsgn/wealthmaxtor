		<strong>For Financial Services</strong>

		<p class="body">From an advisor’s prospect, Imagine if you could stay in touch with your clients and help them to remind about you, every time when they are getting their paycheque!</p>

		<p class="body">Imagine your clients can let you know that they need help to buy their next house with a simple press on an app, that they are using every day to look after their finances.</p>

		<p class="body">Imagine you knew what your client is saving up for when you get that notification of “help needed” (referral program)</p>

		<p class="body">Imagine you go to the client knowing where their money is going.</p>

		<p class="body">In today’s world there are so many solutions for general population, but most of these people do not seek financial help because they think when they don’t have money, it is not worth it. In the result what is happening is people are not being able to go on retirement at a desired age. They are having to work even after they officially retired. If we start solving this issue from the root where it starts, it is definitely possible to get the next generation be able to retire on time and be able to have a successful society, with barely any baby boomers in the community.</p>
