		<h2>Company</h2>
		<p class="body">Wealth Maxtor is offering a service that is unique and has never been done before in the financial services industry. If you are in financial services business what would most advisors find challenging in their job? Our surveys and experience says it’s (a) the Lead generation and (b) Clients not having money to have an appropriate investment in place or to have a life insurance, because they are living paycheque to paycheque.</p>

		<p class="body">Wealth Maxtor solves both of these problems through one solution. It’s a very easy and simple solution. I, the Founder of Wealth Maxtor have started my career in financial services industry as an independent representative, at the age of 24, where I was surrounded by same aged friends. I was already doing well in terms of managing my money through having a split budget of my monthly expenses. The most common problem I used to come across with my friends is that, they do not want to think about the retirement because they do not have money to save and they are living paycheque to paycheque.</p>

		<p class="body">Once I went to visit my long-time friend Z who I have met when I used to go to school. He was working at a kitchen at that time, when I went to see him. I have showed him, how he should be planning for his future now to be where he wants to be. But he could not accept the plan because, he didn’t think he can save money, even though he really wanted to. I have used the same split budget (wealth Maxtor) which says he should be saving 120$/paycheque (he had no clue where this money was going) and placed it in his phone with a reminder on his pay day. After that I haven’t seen him for 6months. I go back to go see him after 6months to see how he is doing. I see a new TV, new coach and his stress free face. I say, looks like you are doing better and he says, it’s all you buddy. That’s exactly when I started to use the Wealth Maxtor for other clients and see results, rest was a story.</p>
